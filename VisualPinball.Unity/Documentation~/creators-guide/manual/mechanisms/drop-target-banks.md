# Drop Target Banks

A Drop Target Bank is a collection of one or more drop targets that are reset -- raised -- when a reset coil is fired.

## Setup

You can create a Drop Target Bank in two different ways.

If your game has a single bank drop target, or multiple single bank drop targets, it is preferred to add it directly to the drop target. Select the Drop Target you want to add it to, click on *Add Component* and select *Visual Pinball -> Game Item -> Drop Target Bank*. 

If your game has drop target banks with multiple drop targets, select Drop Target Bank from the Toolbox. This will add a `Drop Target Banks` folder to the playfield. Each Drop Target Bank added via the toolbox will be automatically incremented, ex. `DropTargetBank1`, `DropTargetBank2`.
